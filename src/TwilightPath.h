/** 
 *  Carries data about a single path which includes two lines, roughly
 *  like hands of a clock, which show the specific times of the sun
 *  hitting a particular "zenith" value (e.g., rise / set times).
 *  These lines are calculated so their outer ends intercept our 24 hour
 *  watchface at the proper points to show their time values.  The lines'
 *  inner ends join with each other at the center of the watchface.
 *  
 *  The remainder of the path extends either up or down (caller selected)
 *  to encompass all of the watch screen above or below the zenith lines.
 *  
 *  The zenith line endpoints are calculated using the presently known
 *  user location, and the current date.
 *  
 *  Our computed path coords are relative, using as a zero-point the axis
 *  of the hour hand's rotation.
 *  
 *  This structure also includes an optional bitmap resource.  When
 *  present, the bitmap is rendered immediately before we fill our path.
 *  When a bitmap is present, our path fill typically is used to carve out
 *  part of the bitmap (which can only be rendered to a rectangle) and
 *  change it back to white.

    *    A path can be concave, but it should not twist on itself
    *    The points should be defined in clockwise order due to the rendering
    *    implementation. Counter-clockwise will work in older firmwares, but
    *    it is not officially supported
    *  
    *  So we change the ordering of our computed points depending on whether
    *  the path is to enclose the top or bottom of the screen, to ensure that
    *  our path goes in a clockwise direction.
